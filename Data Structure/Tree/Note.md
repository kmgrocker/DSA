# Tree 

unlike array , linkedd list or Queue the Tree has non linear structure 

# terminology 

`Node` 
Node ia any data junction point available in Tree 

`Edge`
Edges are the connection between node which represent the herirechy 

`parent`

any Node that is direct predecessor of any other node is called parent 

`Child`

any node that is direct sucessor of any node that is called a child 

`Root Node`

this is the Node from where the Tree originate 
Root Node have no parent 

`Leaf Node`
Leaf Node has No child Node 

`Sibling`

two Node having a same parent called sibling 

`Ancestor` 

parent of the parent node is ancestor for the child 

`Path` 
path taken to reach from one node to another node 

`Disatance` 

Edges covered to reach from one Node to another given node

`Degree of a Node`

degree of a node is decided by how many  child node it has 

`Degree of Tree`

degree of the tree is decided by the maximum number of child node any Node has 

`Depth of Node` 

depth of Node is the number of edges used to reach the node from root 
that way depth of root node is always zero 

`height of Node`

the number of edges from deepest leaf node to that Node 
height of the root Node is same as height of the tree 

# Binary Tree 

Binary Tree has a special implementation of the Tree data Structure in which each node can have maximum two node as a child 

# Binary Search Tree 

Binary Search Tree is the special implementation of the  Binary Tree which has below condition

1. each node has at most two children 
2. the value of each left node must be smaller than the parent node 
3. the value of each right node must be greater than the parent node
